DECLARATION REGARDING INTEREST
DECLARATION REGARDING INTEREST
The undersigned, under penalty of perjury under Washington law, declares the following to be true and correct:
I am the Legal Assistant for the plaintiff and make this declaration in support of entry of extended judgment. Interest was awarded on the judgment, as prayed, at the rate of 12% per annum, post-judgment. The post-judgment interest accured at that rate from {DtJ}, (date of judgment), through April 15th, 2020, and totals ${IntA}. Under Proclamation 20-49 accrual of judgment interest was then frozen from 4/15/2020 until 6/1/2020 when the mandate in Proclamation 20-49 regarding judgment interest was not extended. From June 1, 2020, until {DtRun} interest in the amount of ${IntPost} has accrued at 12% per annum, bringing the total interest accrual to ${j/intA}. As the underlying judment awards interest, an award of interest in this amount is appropriate on the extended judgment.
Certified true and correct under penalty of perjury of the laws of the State of Washington.
