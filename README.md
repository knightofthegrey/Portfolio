# Portfolio
Portfolio of independent projects

My name is Nate Slivka, and this Github repository is a collection of Python projects I've made on my own.

Projects included:
-DeclarationMaker (2023-2024): In 2023 and 2024 I was working as a legal assistant, and created a program to automate the generation of some documents I had to create regularly.
--Features: Parsed data extracted from my employer's database, generated Word documents formatted according to court formatting rules using that data, and manipulated large batches of PDF files to associate evidence with declarations.

-ArsRete (2023-2024): I built a basic neural network as a hobby project in my spare time in 2023 and 2024.
